Just a small note before I begin. I am not a life advisor or anything like that. This is simply a view I have formed by listening to my close friends and by thinking about things happening in my own life.

Life can be daunting at times and can hit you when you least expect it. Over time I started thinking of it like a pizzeria. You are the chef, the pizza is the task at hand and your skills are the brick oven. A brick oven needs coal and has to be lit before cooking. I imagine the coal as the energy or headspace you have throughout the day and the fire as the work you do. You need motivation to light that fire and keep it steady. Then there are external forces that affect the oven temperature and can change the outcome.

I recently watched the re release of the OG Spiderman and one of my favourite dialogues from the movie is:

```
With great power comes great responsibilities
```

I think any power, if it has to become great, needs to be nurtured with responsibility and should grow along with the power itself. In daily life power is the set of skills we have. The idea fits here too. You might have the skill to finish a week's worth of work in one day but you should not because your energy which is the coal in this analogy is limited. Motivation also fades when you push yourself in long stretches.

So the real challenge is how to use energy, motivation and skill responsibly to bake the best pizza possible.

Keeping this challenge in mind these are the few things that I want to highlight

## Knowing when to stop and taking breaks when you are tired

For a Neapolitan pizza to be great it has to be placed at the right spot, the oven has to be at the right temperature not too hot and not too cold and it has to be handled with care. Otherwise it will be burnt on one side and undercooked on the other. You also need to pull it out at the right time. But the oven temperature is not constant throughout the day because the coal keeps reducing. This makes it harder to judge when the pizza is done. If there is less coal the heat drops and the pizza takes longer to cook which makes getting the perfect result harder.

You already know where this is going. You produce your best work only when you have enough energy and a clear mind without external pressure. So it is important to know when to stop and take a break to refill your coal. A break can be sleep, a gaming session, a small walk or anything that clears your head. This helps more than people think and brings consistency just like a stable pizza oven. The result is faster and better work.

## Planning and picking a few tasks that you can do well with the resources you have

With limited pizza dough and limited coal you have to use everything wisely. The oven gives the best result only when it is at the right temperature. We know it does not stay like that for long. This means you should use it well when it is in its best state. Similarly you should pick tasks that matter the most and do them when your mind is most active and you have the highest energy.

Planning your day around the important tasks when your mind is fresh helps a lot. Splitting work into sessions also improves the quality. When you have too much to do you need to understand what is actually possible with the time and energy you have. This avoids frustration and rushed work.

## Consistency, motivation and the downside of too much motivation

Your pizzeria does not become the best in town by doing things right for one day. It needs consistency and that comes only with a steady oven. Temperature control is the key. If it is too high the pizza burns. If it is too low it stays raw. Motivation works the same way. Too much makes you overpromise and under deliver. Too little slows you down and makes the work sloppy. You need just the right amount that sparks action and pushes you to finish your tasks.

## Handling pressure

Your pizzeria might suddenly become popular and you may get many orders at once. But your oven can handle only so much. In such moments you must remember that you can stop taking orders. When pressure becomes too much the quality drops. Then you enter a cycle where you try to fix things in panic and keep returning to the drawing board. The best thing in those moments is to slow down or press the mental do not disturb button. This protects your quality.

## Reflection

Your pizzeria will go through a lot of trial and error before things become right. No one gets it perfect in the first few attempts. It is the small changes and constant improvements that make us better. So it is important to reflect on what went wrong, connect the dots and fix problems from the root. In my case I realised I was overworking by taking on ambitious tasks and overpromising. I forgot that even if I had the skill I did not have the resources like time and headspace. I like relating situations to simple analogies to find the root cause and that is how the pizzeria example came to me.

## In conclusion

- Don't get consumed by pressure
- Plan your tasks based on the resources you have
- Know when to stop and refill your energy
- Stay consistent
- Reflect and improve
