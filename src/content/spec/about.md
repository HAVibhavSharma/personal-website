# About

Hey there! I'm **[Vibhav Sharma](https://github.com/HAVibhavSharma)** — recently turned 25, and I'm on a journey of constant evolution.

## Who I Am

I'm a Data Engineer/Data Science Engineer with a passion for AI research, currently working at **Propheus**, where we're pushing the boundaries of Geospatial AI. But there's more to me than just code and algorithms.

I'm someone with endless curiosity and ideas, though I'll admit — I'm still building the courage to chase them all. What matters is that I'm improving: sharpening my social skills, carving out time for my interests, and turning those ideas into reality. I've even started giving talks and actively working on my social score (yes, that's a real metric I track!), so expect updates on that journey here.

## What I'm About

Sure, you'll find plenty of content about **AI, machine learning, data engineering, and math** — that's my bread and butter. But behind the technical persona, I'm also:

- A passionate **rock climber**
- A dedicated **gym enthusiast** 
- An avid **traveler**
- A hardcore **metalhead** 🤘 (Metallica, Black Sabbath, and Avenged Sevenfold are my gospel)

## What to Expect

This space is where all these worlds collide. You'll get technical deep-dives, but also stories from my adventures, fitness insights, and probably some musings about life set to the soundtrack of heavy metal.

**So, hello — and buckle up for some good articles.**
